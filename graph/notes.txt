Source of this dataset was:
https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ca-GrQc.html
https://snap.stanford.edu/data/

Original dataset was only a list of edges (node1, node2)
5242 Nodes
14496 Edges
A directed graph (each unordered pair of nodes is saved once): CA-GrQc.txt
Collaboration network of Arxiv General Relativity category (there is an edge if authors coauthored at least one paper)

I added additional person details to the records,
and collapsed all edges for a node into a single "collaborators" array.

*** FINAL ENRICHED DATA SET CAN NOW BE LOADED VIA MONGOIMPORT  ***
*** These data modification scripts below are no longer needed ***

Step 1: dataset-original.txt

Step1: dataset-tweaked.txt
Removed the header row
Replaced delimiter with a single space

Step 2: genPeopleDetails.sh
Generates 5500 fake person records to enrich the network data.
Generated data according to the format specified in personDetailsTemplate-basic.json
personDetailsTemplate-fancy was taken from a POV, was called owners.json, something about owners and pets.

Step 3: Build the enriched data set.
Right now this script inserts the records into the database.
TO DO: generate the enriched data set for future use.

Step 4: runGraphLookup.js

To view the output, look for an array with only one collaborator:
{ collaborators: {$size:1} }
Person 21194 is a good example.  Roger Shaw.
He has 1 collaborator. 16258.
In a second tab, we see that 16258 is Tommy Sbolci with 13 collaborators.
Going back to tab 1, look at the graph output and see there are 14 elements.
One of those elements has depth 0, and that is Tommy Sbolci.
The other 13 correspond to Tommy's collaborators.
Strangely, he does not show up as the first element.
